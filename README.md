# MERNChat
# Real time chat application based on MERN stack
Anyone can join rooms and chat with friends

In this application I am using Reactjs for frontend,
Node and expressjs for backend, socket-io and socket-io-client
for real time data transfer between frontend and backend,
And mongoose to store data in MongoDb.
